Write your code to demultiplex the samples. Be sure to:
-Utilize appropriate functions
-Sufficiently comment your code/use docstrings
-Use unit tests on functions/entire algorithm to ensure it works properly
-Create a useful report for the end user of your code
-Use argparse to "generalize" your code
[skipped] -Follow the specifications laid out in Demultiplexing, part 1 for the code


Final work will be submitted on GitHub. Make sure your repo is well organized and final output is clearly labeled/summarized. Use your code to demultiplex the samples and report:
-Percentage of reads from each sample
-Overall amount of index swapping
[skipped] -Any figures/any other relevant data your code output
